This script iterates over all files in the specified directory (files/), reads the content of each file, and replaces all occurrences of 'amount' with 'units'. It then writes the modified content back to the respective file.

Ensure that the directory containing the files you want to modify is named files and placed in the project folder.

Run the script:

``python file_content_modifier.py``

Ensure that the directory structure and filenames match the provided instructions. Adjust the directory name (files) as needed if your directory has a different name. Make sure to have appropriate permissions to read and write files within the specified directory.
